        <section>
            <p>Hi and welcome to the first appear.in API tutorial. Here, we'll create a simple web application that creates and embeds an appear.in room directly on your site.</p>
    
            <p>If you are looking for is a simple embeddable version, this is something that we are working on, but is not ready for prime time just yet.</p>
    
            <p>The API is currently severly undocumented, but can assure you that proper documentation is underway. For now, we hope that this tutorial will provide you with the knowhow necessary to create applications using appear.in.</p>

                <p>In addition to our JavaScript librabry, we require you to include jQuery for the <code>postMessage</code> API to perform like require it to. We are looking into ways making this optional.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The first thing we will have to do is to check if the client browser supports the technologies that is needed for appear.in to work properly. While appear.in itself will display an error message when a non-supported browser is detected, you might want to do this on your site instead to improve user experience. We have created a simple javascript library that you can use on your site. This library is loaded by including the following line <em>after</em> including jQuery.</p>
        
        <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://iswebrtcready.appear.in/apiv2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>This lets you run our test battery by running the <code>API.isApperinCompatible()</code> method.</p>
        
        <pre><code>API.isAppearinCompatible(function (data) {
            // the call was successful
            window.console.log(data);
        }, function (error) {
            // the call was unsuccessful
            window.console.log(error);
        })
        </code></pre>
        
                <p>This will run all the tests available in our test battery (1) and return a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> boolean, as well as an array containing the result of all the tests that has been run. Refer to the output of the <code>window.console.log(data)</code> for the complete content until the API documentation is finished.</p>
        
                <h3 id="technicaldeets">Technical deets</h3>
        
                <p>The tests are run by embedding a minimal iframed version of the <a href="http://iswebrtcready.appear.in">iswebrtcready.appear.in</a> test web site which will run all of our tests and report the results back to your site. We plan to package these test for you to put on your site without the need for embedding our tests.</p>
        
                <h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
        
                <p>While we will keep the <code>apiv2.js</code> file and its syntax and methods available for the forseeable future and we will try to let you know of any changes you should know about using <code>console.log</code> messages. That being said, this is a very early and experimental version of the API and the final version <em>will be changed</em>. A new API javascript library will be provided as soon as we feel it to be ready. <a href="http://eepurl.com/J-_Qr">Sign up to our mailing list</a> to be notified when this happens.</p>

            <section>
                
                <p>After making sure that the client browser support appear.in, we will go on to create a room that you can use. Our API does not yet expose the ability to create rooms programatically (2), so for now we'll have to exploit the ability of appear.in to create a room from any given string. By creating a suffiently long randomly generated string, this will give us a statistical "guarantee" that the room is unoccupied. The longer the string, the smaller the chance of creating a room that is already occupied. We'll create a room name with thirty alphanumeric characters, which will give us 36<sup>30</sup>, or a few tredecillions shy of 49 quattuordecillion, possible character combinations.</p>
        
<pre><code>var randomRoomNameGenerator = function () {
    // predefine the alphabet used.
    var alphabet = 'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm1234567890';

    // set the lenght of the room name
    var roomNameLength = 30;

    // initialize the room name as an empty string
    var roomName = '';

    // repeat this 30 times
    for (var i=0; i&lt;roomNameLength; i++) {
        // get a random character from the alphabet
        var character = alphabet[Math.round(Math.random()*(alphabet.length-1))];

        // add the character to the roomName
        roomName = roomName + character;
    }

    // pre- and append appear.in URL elements
    roomName = 'https://appear.in/' + roomName + '?lite';

    // return the result
    return roomName;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This method will return a valid roomname, ready to be inserted into an achor tag or even an iframe.</p>

                <p>Appear.in rooms are possible to embed inside ordinary iframes, making it possible to create entire video based services using appear.in rooms as their base. To do this we'll simply set the iframe <code>src</code> attribute to the generated room name.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;My awesome service&lt;/h1&gt;

            window.createRoom = function () {
                // setting a room name. Pair this with the random room generator code above for real power
                var roomName = 'this-is-a-room';
                roomName = 'https://appear.in/' + roomName + '?lite';

                // set the iframe source to load the room
                var iframe = document.getElementById('appearin-room')
                iframe.setAttribute('src', roomName);
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

        
                <h3 id="userexperience">User experience</h3>
        
                <p>It is very possible to have the room load automatically as the site itself has loaded, making you enter a room immidiately. Just keep in mind that many does not want their face to be broadcasted to others without their express knowledge and consent.
                Browsers will display a camera access request dialog the first time a web site requests access to it, but seeing as the camera access dialog comes from the appear.in domain, this means that if the user has ever allowed camera access to appear.in the camera and microphone will automatically turn on when the iframe has loaded. We recommend activating the iframe after the user has expressed consent through clicking a button or similar.</p>
        
                <p>This is something that we are working on a solution to improve, more specifically, we are working on a branded preloader that will handle this for you. A preview of this preloader can be found on our <a href="http://appearin.github.io/githut">githut demo</a>.</p>
